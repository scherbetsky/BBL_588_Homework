# The noise type on Figure_1 is salt and pepper noise
# This kind of noise is caused by too high and too low pixel values in the image
# By applying median filter this too high and too low pixel values can be replaced by overall median pixel value
# Median filter takes the median value and applies it to the extreme pixels
